# weekly-planner
This is a work day schedule for adding events for specific times. It features an hour for each time block, a text area for
storing events and a save button to lock in events. With the use of local storage the events persist even when the page 
is refreshed. The events will not be saved unless the user clicks the save button. As well the website uses moment.js to
track the current day and time. The current week day, day number, and month is displayed on top of the page.
